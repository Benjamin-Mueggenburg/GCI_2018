**Task Description**:

_When you fork a repo from SCoRe repository and clone it on your machine, you have to pull the newest changes from SCoRe repository time to time because your forked repo doesn't get automatically updated with the changes in SCoRe repository._

#### _**Task**_

_How we usually do this is by adding the SCoRe repository as git remote named upstream. upstream is just a fancy name, you can name it any way you like, but we all use it as a convention._

_Your task is to add the SCoRe repository as upstream and pull changes from it._

_Send up screenshots of the terminal when you do,_

_1) `git remote -v` after adding upstream_

_2) Fetch the changes from upstream. (`git fetch upstream`)_

_3) Merge the changes from upstream. (`git merge upstream/master`)_

#### _**Task Deliverables:**_ 
_Upload a screenshots: Terminal outputs of step 1, 2 and 3._
